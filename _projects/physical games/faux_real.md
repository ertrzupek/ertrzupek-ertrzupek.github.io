game basics & my roles:

1. designed game around the following four constraints
   1. childhood memories
   2. unilateral (3v1) player interaction
   3. press your luck (major mechanic)
   4. some sort of race aspect
2. created the rules of the game, focusing on clarity and ease of understanding
3. took detailed notes during each playtest for immediate player reactions, issues that arise and possible solutions
4. carefully created a playtest survey to assess the game's success
5. compiled playtest survey results and presented findings to the group for next steps
6. maintained detailed design journal to summarize game progress through the development cycle
7. designed clone question cards to be on theme with game & came up with unique and interesting prompts for each
