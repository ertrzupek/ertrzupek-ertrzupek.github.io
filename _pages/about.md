I'm a game designer and photographer with home bases in Los Angeles and Hartford. I've been producing small game projects for years now, starting with Minecraft plugins and mods in Java about 5 years ago.

I'm currently attending USC's Viterbi School of Engineering, studying Computer Science with an emphasis on video game design. I'm also minoring in photography!

Some of my favorite games are Hades, Balatro, Minecraft, Stardew Valley, and any of the LEGO games.
